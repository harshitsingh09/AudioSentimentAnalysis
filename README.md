## Installation and Execution Instructions

### 1. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. If you haven't already, create one:

```bash
python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment named "venv"
```
#### Activate the virtual environment:

On Linux/macOS:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory where the requirements.txt file is located. Then, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will install all the libraries listed in requirements.txt, such as numpy, pandas, librosa, keras, and any other necessary dependencies.

### 3. Run the Application
After installing the dependencies, you can run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```
This command will execute the main.py file and start the audio classification process.
